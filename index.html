                The first project is the site you are in now, which is
                considered one of the largest projects that I have done so far
                and this is because it contains a lot of animations ,Many
                programming languages were used away from CSS and HTML that we
                used Java Script in this website

                The second project I worked on is the first website i did it ,
                but it does not contain many effects and animations and only
                html and CSs language is used on building it, but it was a big
                job to me as it was a strong bush to keep me on track
